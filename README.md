Secured Palette, a Streamlit-based web app in Python, bolsters information security by seamlessly integrating LSB steganography and visual cryptography. During encoding, the app subtly embeds text within an image using LSB steganography, ensuring imperceptible alterations. Visual cryptography further divides the encoded image into two shares, independently revealing no information. Only when superimposed, the original image emerges, enhancing security. For decoding, users upload visual cryptography shares, leading to image reconstruction. LSB steganography is then applied to extract concealed text. This dual-layered approach combines LSB's obscurity with visual cryptography's cryptographic resilience, providing robust data protection against unauthorized access.
